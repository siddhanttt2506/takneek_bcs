# Quest 1 : Do I know you?

(1) QLoRA_finetune.ipynb is used for fine tuning the model using QLoRA in batches several times (The code in it is for the final batch fine tuning).

(2) dataset_creation.ipynb is used to convert the .jsonl question answer files into a hugging face dataset so that it could be used to fine tune the model.

This is the link for the hugging face model https://huggingface.co/ashishu23/model1/tree/main

Some example datasets used for fine tuning the model are :
